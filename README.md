c. [This Java project is an input error-proof int[] array builder. It allows users to safely build an array of integers based on specific requirements, including array length, element values, and error checking for user input.]

d. [

1. When you run the program, you'll see a welcome message and a prompt asking how many elements you'd like the array to have.
2. Enter an integer from 0 to 20 (inclusive) as the array size. If you enter an invalid input, the program will prompt you again until a valid input is provided.
3. If the array size is greater than 0, you'll be prompted to enter integers between 0 and 50 (inclusive) for each element of the array.
4. Follow the prompts to input values for each element. Invalid inputs will be rejected, and you'll be asked to enter a valid value.
5. After entering all the array elements, the program will display the array values and a visual representation of each element using asterisks.

e. The code works fine with no issue.]
